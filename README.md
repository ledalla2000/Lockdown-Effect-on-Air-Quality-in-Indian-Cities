# Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the Air Quality in Indian cities

Analysing AQI data of 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the effect of COVID-19 lock down in India.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on global economic activity. Despite
the fact that it consumed a large number of human breaths and increased unemployment, it has
a favourable impact on the environment. To slow the spread of the sickness, the government
placed a rigorous lockdown on its residents, which had a positive impact on the environment.
The influence of lockdown on the environment was evaluated using air pollutant concentrations
in this study. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is calculated based on the concentration of air
pollutants. The Air Quality Index shows which cities in our country are the most and least
polluted. A higher AQI number indicates a more polluted city, while a lower AQI value indicates
a less polluted city. The impact of lockdown on air quality was investigated in this study, and
it was discovered that during the lockdown period, air pollutant concentrations decreased in
every city across the country. The main impacting air concentrators that control the air quality
of all the selected sites before, during, and after lockdown have also been identified as PM 2.5
and PM 10.
